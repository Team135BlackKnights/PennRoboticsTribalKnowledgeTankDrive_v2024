Welcome Programmers!
---------------------
This is the example tank drive code for Penn Robotics.
Its purpose is simply to help you see the entirety of the example code, 
so that you may be able to code and double check that your work is accurate
to the example. Obviously you can go outside of the code, such as change
the names of variables, as well as the true values for the actuateIntake()
function, but this will allow you to make sure that all of the code is 
accurate overall.

Good luck on future programmers!
